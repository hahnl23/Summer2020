import java scanner
Declare public static integer FinalScore
Declare scanner
For each method, add a scanner for the return value
Ask the user if they want to play the game yes or no
Create string YesOrNo that equals the next line
Create integer repeated that equals zero
While 
	-YesOrNo equals yes then ask user if they want to play sports words guessing game or even numbers game
	- Make String WordsOrNum that equals the next line
	- if statement = WordsOrNum equals words, then transfer program to the public static Words()
	- if WordsOrNum equals numbers then transfer program to the public static
Ask user if they want to play again by answering yes or no
YesOrNo equals the next line
Make repeated++
If 
	- YesOrNo equals no, then print that the game has ended and print the final score
	- Print the number of attempts with repeated
Make a public static void Words(String wordinput)  throws FileNotFoundException
Create a file called file that has a pathname correspondent to the file text program with 20 tokens in 20 lines
Create integer n that equals 0
Make a new scanner called Scanner that corresponds with file
While 
	-while scanner has the next line, the String nextToken is equal to the next scanner
	- if statement = nextToken equals the word of the user input, then tell the user congrats they have guessed the right word and get one point.
Final score advancing by ++
Do the same class as numbers, but change the file to a different text file.
