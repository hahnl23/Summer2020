/* Lian Hahn pseudocode
Import scanner
Ask user to input a word count
Declare prompt integer "promptWord" that equals the next integer
Make a for loop for integer s
    - s is less than promptWord
Declare new String string1
do loop
    - ask user to input word
    - make string1 equal the next line
    - close do loop
While loop
    - length of string1 is less than 2
    - length of string1 is bigger than 10
Declare new String word1 that equals word1(string1)
Print the equivalent of word1
Public static void String word1(String string1)
Declare string even1
Declare string odd1
Make for loop for integer even2
    - less than the length of string1
    - must be in multiples of 2 starting from 0 to be even
    - create char letter that equals the character at even2 on string1
    - make even1 equal even1 plus char letter
Make for loop for odd2
    - less than the length of string1
    - must be in multiples of 2 starting from 1 to be odd
    - create char letter that equals the character at odd2 on string1
    - make odd1 equal odd1 plus char letter
Make return method for even1 and odd1 with a space in between
