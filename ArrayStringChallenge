/* Lian Hahn's pseudocode
import scanner
Create scanner input
make integer (int1)
make string (string1)
Create a do loop
    - ask user how many words they are going to enter
    - make int1 equal to the next integer input
    - close do loop
While
    - int1 must be less than 1
    - int1 must be greater than 10
    - Make string array for inputWord that equals the string just inputed int1
    - Make string array for outputWord that equals the string just inputed int1
For loop
    - integer i
    - i is equal to zero
    - i is less than int1
Do loop
    -Ask user to enter word
    -make string1 equal to the next input
    - this next input is i
While
    - the length of string1 is less than 2 and the length of string1 is bigger than 10000
    - make the outputWord[i] equal to the string Console(inputWord[i])
For loop
    - make integer i equal to zero
    - i is less than int1
    - print the outputWord[i]
Create new public static string Console (String string2)
Create String even1 that is equal to ""
Create String odd1 that is equal to ""
For loop
    - create integer even
    - make it equal to zero
    - make it less than the length of string2 and has to be multiples of two from zero
    - create char letter that is equal to the character at string2 when it is odd
    - make even1 equal even1 plus that letter
For loop
    - create integer odd
    - make it equal to one
    - make it less than the length of string2 and has to be multiples of two from one
    - create char letter that is equal to the character at string2 when it is odd
    - make odd1 equal odd1 plus that letter
Return method for even1 and odd1
