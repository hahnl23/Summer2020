/* Lian Hahn's Pseudocode:
Import scanner
Declare three integers (temp, total, and average) that equal zero
Declare random (randy) that is a new random
Declare integer index that equals zero
Do loop
    - Ask user how many days they want to know the high temp
    - temp equals console.nextInt();
While
    - temp must be greater than two and less than 100
the integer array myArray is equal to the integer array temp
For loop
    - index is zero
    - index is less than the length of myArray
    -the index of myArray is the random integer bound: by 85 and then everything plus 25
    - Print the day and the index plus one: and the index of myArray with degrees at the end
    - the total is the total plus the index of myArray
Make the average equal to the total divided by the temp
Print the average temperature of all the days
Declare integer counter that equals zero
Make for loop
    - index is zero
    - index is less than the length of myArray
    - if statement (the index of myArray is greater than the average), then counter++
Print how many days are above average using counter
