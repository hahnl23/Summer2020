/*
Lian Hahn's psuedocode:
declare a 'char' that equals 65
make a for loop for the integer top
top will equal 5, be greater or equal to zero, and be decreasing every step (--)
make a for loop inside of the previous for loop for the integer i
i equals 0, is less than or equal to top, and is increasing every step (++)
System print the char variable plus i and a space with both of the loops
close the second loop and put a space
close the first loop
repeat the two for loops again, but for the top loop, top equals 0, and is less than or equal to five
make sure the progarm works run it a few times
input a Size = 5
change the 5's in the program to Size
run again with Size
