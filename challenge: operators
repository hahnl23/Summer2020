Lian Hahn's Psuedocode:
Import scanner
Input the cost of the meal before tax and tip (mealCost) with system.print and scanner
Input the percentage of cost of meal being added as tip (tipPercent) with system.print and scanner
Input the percentage of cost of meal being added as tax (taxpercent) with system.print and scanner
Declare variables for doubles tip, tax, and totalCost
Make equation for tip (tip = mealCost * 20/100)
Make equation for tax (tax = mealCost * 8/100)
Make equation for totalCost (mealCost + tip + tax)
Round the totalCost 
Print totalCost
